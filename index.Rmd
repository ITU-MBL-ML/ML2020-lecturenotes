# Syllabus {#intro}

## Class Schedule

**Spring 2020**
Tuesday 13:30-1630

## Content
The course is an introduction to Machine Learning methods with examples from architectural design and creative coding. The course follows a hands on approach with many examples that will be developed during the course. The course includes topics from machine learning such as linear regression, unsupervised learning, supervised learning, reinforcement learning and finally neural networks. 
## Aims
To have students acquire practical knowledge on the tools of machine learning and different methodologies. To have students knowledge of applying these techniques to creative design process. 

## Conduct
The first half of the term includes introduction to the various machine learning topics. In this phase there will be practical coding sessions and some assignments which will be graded. In the second half of the term we will focus on a group project which will be developed using neural networks. 

## Assessment

The grading for the course is as follows: hands-on practices, 50%; final group project 50%.

### Assignments
TBA

### Final Project
TBA

## Software
We will use Python in an Anaconda environment.
