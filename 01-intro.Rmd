In the first week we had a talk about the course syllabus and discussed about Machine Learning examples.

For the second week we will do a refresher on Python. Please bring your laptops and install Anaconda with Python 3.7.

5. Make kernel accessible in jupyter notebook:

6. Go to the directory that you would like to save your notebooks
