The course follows a hands on approach with many examples that will be developed during the course. The course includes topics from machine learning such as linear regression, unsupervised learning, supervised learning, reinforcement learning and finally neural networks. ## Aims To have students acquire practical knowledge on the tools of machine learning and different methodologies. To have students knowledge of applying these techniques to creative design process. 1.3 Conduct The first half of the term includes introduction to the various machine learning topics. In this phase there will be practical coding sessions and some assignments which will be graded. In the second half of the term we will focus on a group project which will be developed using neural networks. 1.4 Assessment The grading for the course is as follows: hands-on practices, 50%; final group project 50%. 1.4.1 Assignments TBA 1.4.2 Final Project TBA 1.5 Software We will use Python in an Anaconda environment. 1.6 Outline Week 1 Introduction Week 2 Refresher on Python Week 3 Data scraping &amp; Linear Regression week 4 Unsupervised Learning Week 5 Supervised Learning Week 6 Reinforcement Learning Week 7 Introduction to Neural Networks Week 8 Break Week 9 Neural Network examples - Project Discussion Week 10 Neural Network examples Week 11 Neural Network examples Week 12 Projects Week 13 Projects Week 14 Projects Week 15 Projects "],
["week-1.html", "Chapter 2 Week 1 2.1 Install Anaconda", " Chapter 2 Week 1 In the first week we had a talk about the course syllabus and discussed about Machine Learning examples. For the second week we will do a refresher on Python. Please bring your laptops and install Anaconda with Python 3.7. 2.1 Install Anaconda Install Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section Click on start menu and choose anaconda prompt’(windows) OR run terminal (osx/ubuntu) Create a virtual environment (e.g. ‘mbl-ml’, could be any name you like): • &gt; conda create -n mbl-ml python=3.7 ipykernel Activate the virtual environment: • &gt; source activate mbl-ml Install dependencies: • Change directory to where the given file (requirements.txt) resides. • &gt; cd (just drag your folder into the cmd/terminal) • &gt; pip install -r requirements.txt Make kernel accessible in jupyter notebook: • &gt; python -m ipykernel install –user –name mbl-ml Go to the directory that you would like to save your notebooks • &gt; cd (just drag your folder into the cmd/terminal) Run jupyter notebook: • &gt; jupyter notebook Create new file and set kernel to ‘mbl-ml’ To shut down jupyter: • Press cmd ‘C’ or &gt; ctrl ‘C’ at the terminal/cmd prompt To deactivate virtual environment: • &gt; conda deactivate "]
